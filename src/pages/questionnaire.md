Here are some questions that will **help me understand your needs** and how I can assist you. Once I get the answers, we can schedule a call to discuss further.

- What is the goal of having this website? What do you want users to achieve when they visit?
- Do you intend to sell products or services on the site? This is crucial information as it impacts various decisions, so I should know this up-front.
- Is this a completely new website, or do you currently have one?
- Do you need me to handle the entire process, from design to launch, or do you have designers or other partners lined up and only need me for development?
- Do you have any rough designs or ideas for the site? Are there any similar websites you admire or dislike?
- Do you have the logo, content and images ready, or will you need help with those?
- Do you have hosting and a domain name?
- What is the project timeline? Is there anything driving it to be done by a certain date?
- How much money have you set aside for this project?
- Is there any additional information I should be aware of?
