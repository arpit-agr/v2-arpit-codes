Jason Lengstorf on server side rendering and SEO:

> The less work we make Google's bots do for content, the more likely the content is going to show up high in the rankings.
>
> Let me be clear, the most important thing about SEO is writing something that somebody wants to read. There is no amount of technical hacks that is going to suddenly make content that people aren't interested in show up at the top of the rankings.
>
> ... Yes, server side rendering is helpful. No, it is not more important that writing good content.

Robin Rendle on what grief is and what it isn't:

> As we walk around the next corner—one more left—I start thinking about what grief is, how it works, how to live alongside it. It feels like grief is an intergalactic atom bomb of sadness and misery that tears apart everything in its wake but as I look at this boy in my arms I know that grief isn’t that. Grief is love crushed into a tiny dot, love bottled up over years and years, love distilled into a single atom only to explode and release all its energy at the moment something terrible happens. I remember what my therapist said a while ago, that grief can’t be argued against, it can’t be intellectually maneuvered or circumnavigated. “Grief is grief,” he said. And it’s true. But knowing that doesn’t help me because I am still scared for tomorrow, I am still scared for the bomb and for the grief. I’m just not ready. I don’t want to say goodbye. I want to hold this old dog in my arms forever. I want to stay on this block, frozen in this happy place.

I need to assimilate layout algorithms into my mental-model for CSS.
