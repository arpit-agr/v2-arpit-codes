I'm a self-taught web developer/software engineer with expertise in building scalable, performant websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as a myriad of other technologies.

I never imagined I would be starting a blog. And for that I must thank [Rach](https://rachsmith.com/why-write/) [Smith](https://rachsmith.com/fuck-it/), [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/11/üß†üí≠‚úè%EF%B8%8F/) [Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/27/there-is-no-bar/), [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/take-care-of-your-blog-/) and [Matthias Ott](https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there). Their posts gave me the courage to go ahead and start blogging.

In true developer fashion though, I ended up redesigning my website in the process of writing this post.

I was nervous[^1] to write a _public_ blog. Moreover, I had no idea what I was going to write about. So, I immediately went back to doing something more in my comfort zone ‚Äî endlessly redesigning this website.

It wasn‚Äôt a waste of time though. I like the design‚Ä¶ _for the time being_[^2]. Plus it gave me something to write about.

In the end:

- <s><span class="vh">This text has been striked out.</span>It doesn‚Äôt even matter</s>[^3]
- I hope this blog becomes a record of what I‚Äôm learning.
- I hope it becomes a journal, one I can read years down the line, to understand the ways in which I may have changed.

For now, it‚Äôs time to publish.

[^1]: I still am nervous.
[^2]: <q>I am perpetually unsatisfied with it</q> ‚Äî as [Jim Nielsen](https://twitter.com/jimniels/status/1573873793138835458/photo/1) puts it for his personal website.
