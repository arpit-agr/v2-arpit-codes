Jason Lengstorf on server side rendering and SEO:

> The less work we make Google's bots do for content, the more likely the content is going to show up high in the rankings.
>
> Let me be clear, the most important thing about SEO is writing something that somebody wants to read. There is no amount of technical hacks that is going to suddenly make content that people aren't interested in show up at the top of the rankings.
>
> [â€¦] Yes, server side rendering is helpful. No, it is not more important that writing good content.
