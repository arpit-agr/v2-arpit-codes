From the spec:

> The generic form of the `repeat()` syntax is, approximately,
>
> `repeat( [ <integer [1,âˆž]> | auto-fill | auto-fit ] , <track-list> )`
>
> The first argument specifies the number of repetitions. The second argument is a track list, which is repeated that number of times.

#TIL that the second argument to the CSS `repeat()` notation can take one or more values along with line names before or after each track.
